# vidi-egu2025

A repository to:
1. Process satellite gravimetry Level-2 data
2. Compute TWS anomalies in the Greater Horn of Africa
3. Process ERA-5 data
4. Reduce leakage error in the basins of the Greater Horn of Africa 
   *(The generated module will be moved to xinv later after generalizing leakage functions, which might support leakage reduction estimation in the inversion-0 scheme)*
5. Write modules to estimate trends, seasonality, etc
6. Create and manage a branch for the poster document
